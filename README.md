# dreamcatcher
This is one of pet projects in which I started working before years.  
I like to do things that makes me happy.  
I like to do things that are interesting.  
I like to do things that I am passionate about.

In summary, all of it comes down to a single word - Motivation.  
But, my own experience taught me that motivation is like fuel.  
It burns out after a while. You need to refuel often.  
And this project is my digital solution to a basic issue.  
**"How to keep my self motivated everyday, every moment?"**
